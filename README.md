# Shortest Path Game

## Overview

This project is a mobile game developed using React Native (Expo) that teaches children aged 7 to 8 years old how to find the shortest path in a graph. The game is designed to be educational and engaging, helping young players develop problem-solving skills through interactive gameplay.

## Requirements

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: Download and install from [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- **Expo CLI**: The command-line tool for creating and managing React Native projects with Expo.
- **Git**: For cloning the repository and version control.
- **A Mobile Device or Emulator**: To run the app (Expo Go app for physical devices).

### Optional Tools

- **Visual Studio Code**: Recommended IDE for coding.
- **Android Studio**: For running an Android emulator.
- **Xcode**: For iOS development on macOS.

## Installation Guide

### 1. Install Node.js

If Node.js isn't installed on your system, download it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and follow the installation instructions.

### 2. Install Expo CLI

Expo CLI helps you create, build, and serve React Native apps:

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```

### 3. Clone the Repository

Use Git to clone the project repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jigs1188/game
cd shortest-path-game
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies for the project:

```bash
npm install
```

### 5. Start the Expo Development Server

Launch the development server with:

```bash
npm start
```

This command will open the Expo DevTools in your browser, where you can manage your project.

### 6. Run the App on Your Device or Emulator

- **On a Physical Device**: Install the Expo Go app from the App Store (iOS) or Google Play (Android). Scan the QR code in the Expo DevTools with the Expo Go app to run the project on your device.
- **On an Emulator**: If you have an Android or iOS emulator set up, you can run the app directly on the emulator from the Expo DevTools interface.

## Troubleshooting

- **Dependency Issues**: If you encounter issues with dependencies, run `npm install` to ensure everything is installed.
- **Node Version**: Ensure you're using Node.js version 12 or higher.
- **Expo Errors**: Check the Expo DevTools for any runtime errors and follow the suggested fixes.

## Next Steps

After setting up the project, you can start working on the game's features, such as interactive graph rendering, pathfinding algorithms, and user interface improvements. The current phase involves manually solving the shortest path problem, with plans to implement more complex algorithms in future updates.
